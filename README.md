# MealPlanner - React app integrated with server 

In 2020 I participated in Nucamp's Full-Stack bootcamp. In the second course, we created dynamic web applications with React, and in the last phase, we were taught how to develop a backend with NodeJS.

This project is the front end of my Meal Planner React application. There is a server connected to this app. [Go to the server repository.](https://github.com/madisonisfan/meaplannerServer-integration)

## My Inspiration
For almost my entire life I've had a passion for health and fitness. Like most people, I found it difficult to find healthy foods that I enjoy and to stay consistent with healthy eating. My goal is to create a place for people to go where they can organize their weekly meal plans, and be motivated by the community integrated with the site. To help with finding food options for everyone, I created a feature that allows anyone to add a recipe to the site. With everyone adding recipes, there would be an extensive list of food.  

## Features
- Recipe Page: Here, users can view all recipes and sort the recipes by meal type (ex: Breakfast). From here, users can also choose to add a recipe to the site, and favorite recipes from the lists. 
- Mealplan Page: This page is where users can view and edit their meal plan for the week. 
- Blog: To create a community, I added a blog feature that allows users to interact with each other. People can create posts and view and comment on each other's posts. 
- Profile Page: Here users can view and edit their details, such as recipes 

## Project Confusion
Why are there so many repositories?: 
- The bootcamp was separated into 4 courses. The 2nd was React, and the last was Backend. 
- In the React course, I created this Meal Planner React app and it is not integrated with a server. 
- In the backend course, I created a Meal Planner server not integrated with a React app
- As an extra, we were taught to integrate a React app with a server. But to do so, we created separate projects which were copies of our react app and server, but with a few new additions.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Available Scripts



### `yarn eject`

<!--

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
